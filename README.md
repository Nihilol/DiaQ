# DiaQ
The library DiaQ was developed at the Spin Qubit Group, at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen. I, Oliver Liebe, am the author of all code. 

It is meant as a quick way to diagnose potential failure modes, stemming from fabrication. It does this by analysing a design file, assigning each gate with inherent properties, and then analysing the leakage matrix of said device.
